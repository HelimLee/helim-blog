<p>Admit it or not, every story, including stories in fictional writings and stories in real life, all have its own endings. Sun will explode in the future, while even the universe will destroy itself after a countable time. People like dividing endings to several or only two groups. One group is called "Happy Ending", while the other is called "Bad Ending". Both the names show the people's opinions on these two different types of the endings.<br>Happy Ending, as known as HE, stands for a ending that all the people important in the story finally gathered together. Or as a traditional happy ending said, "the princess and the prince lived happily together forever." We all like this type of the endings, for it will comfort our heart, give us a positive outlook on our daily life. However, reading too many happy-ending literature works can lead to a lack of the heart's strength. It's a simple rule: If you haven't gotten used to the bad ending in artwork, you won't get used to the one in your real life either. And that lack of inside strength can result in unhappiness or weakness before a challenge.<br>Nobody hates happy ending, everyone wants all the roles in the story can get their reward and achieve a happy life. But life itself is a non-fictional book, with hundreds of bad news included. Happy endings are different inside too. Some of them just tell a worthless fun and happy story, while others can show the success of fighting against the role's fate. The second one, however, is more valuable than the first one, while showing its readers that justice will end the darkness.<br>Bading Ending, as known as BE, is on the other hand. In some ways, bad ending inspires people more than happy endings. People will remember bad news more clearer than good news because of humanity's instincts that are deep in the DNA. While remembering takes the first place, understanding will followed as the second place. As time passes, readers will get both inspired from their daily life and weekly readings. They are not only inspired by the roles in the book, but also by the people in their real life who have similar experiences to the content's roles. In some cases, readers themselves can experience what the bad ending stories' roles are facing -- endless failures or the hopeless.<br>I am not talking about that a BE story can inspire readers more because most of the readers are facing difficulties instead of enjoying happiness, but I am figuring out a theory from the fact that everyone remembers bad news better. The theory is, when you are writing a happy ending, readers may stop connecting your storyline to their own lifelines, because the happiest times in their life have already been forgotten by themselves. On the other side, when reading a bad ending story, sad memories like walking in a rainy street without an umbrella which are basically matters little can be strengthed in readers' minds. They will make connections between a fictional story to their real life, even if they are living a wealthy and healthy life, they can still connect it, and feel what the roles inside the stories are feeling.<br>To stories, endings do matter. Whatever ending the story has, it has an ending anyway, so it is a completed story. Everyone wants to read a completed story instead of a semi-completed story with plenty of unsolved mysteries and unclear roles' storylines in the end. You do things, so you should get a result. This is what a story should be, and often, it will be written in this style.<br>But the life is different. Many people suppose their lives to be something they want and take action to get closer to their goals. As they are taking actions, they are expecting an ending, mostly they hope for a happy ending. And your fate doesn't always satisfy you, over 90 per cents of your actions won't result in anything. People don't feel it because most of these actions are too tiny to be noticed, maybe they never realized that they have done something like that. They fill themselves with an illusion that every effort leads to a happier ending. Finally, when a larger action got ignored or nothing in results, or even worse, leads to something bad, they cry. Crying about their poor situation. But all these things, all the endings take place randomly! Life is a book, a play, but not a tale or fictional story. Nobody promised that you will get results or an ending. And mostly you won't get one.<br>So it's time to stop expecting too much. Endings are not something you must have, for you are not a role who is living in a fairy tale, but a 100% human life on this blue planet in our solar system. We should not put all the eggs in one basket and let the so called "god" or "fate" to decide an ending for us. We should take all the future in our own hands. Change every life for the better as more as we can, and devote our own heart to daily life.</p>
